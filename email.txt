Dear Ehsan,
My name is Sava Spasojevic. I am contacting you regarding openings at AXA Advisors. I interviewed with you before, but I had left the interview process rather abruptly on the morning of our third interview. I acknowledge that it wasn't a professional move on my part and offer my most sincere apologies. At the time, I had conflicting opinions from family members regarding commission based work and was still uncertain of my true career path. 
Since then I have resolved all issues, realized that I am destined for wealth management, and have made considerable progress in my understanding of markets through astute observation and quantitative analysis. What qualifies me for this role are my exceptional sales capabilities, knowledge, and interpersonal skills. I have an unmatched tenacity to succeed, and with the right support the sky's the limit. 
I have composed a powerpoint presentation, which I built off of my previous one, attached it to this email, and have developed a website that I will showcase in conjunction with my presentation if we are to proceed with our third interview. I'm confident that I can build a substantial book of business and obtain my series 66 and 7 in three months or less. Let me know what you think, as well as a good date and time that works for you. Thanks again for your consideration and I look forward to hearing back from you.
Sincerely, Sava Spasojevic
