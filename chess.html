					<li><figure><a href = "https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1233404"><img src = "morphy.png" alt = "chessposition" style=" width: 250px; height:250px;padding-right: 0px;"><figcaption><h3>Paul Morphy vs. Duke Karl / Count Isouard.</h3></figcaption></a>
					</figure>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 35px;">Morphy is applying unrelenting pressure here. For a detailed analysis of this game, refer to an excerpt of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4oMkwfQCao">Ben Finegold's lecture on Paul Morphy.</a> Be warned however, it's the U1000 class. Still very instructive.</p>

					</figure>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 35px;">My current favorite opening, the Colle system. It is not an irrefutable opening, but has its advantages in prepping an e4 pawn push, establishing the center, and potentially getting some good play on the c-file. The reason that I like it is because it gives me an objective in the opening, so that I don't have to play a strict guessing game for the first ten or so moves. Refer to <a href= "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85086.Logical_Chess_Move_By_Move">Irving Chernev's Logical Chess.</a></p></li>

					</figure>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 35px;">This is a game that I got from Zenon Franco's book on Spassky. In his assessment of Spassky's play he gives two similar games, i.e. Taimanov vs. Najdorf (Zurich 1953) and Piket vs. Kasparov (Tilburg 1989), as a supplement. This game is discussed in the "Initiative and Attack" section of the book. The moves that have improved my game were a result of studying Spassky's pawn pushes, notice the pawn on f4, as well as his superior claim to the h-file.</p></li>
