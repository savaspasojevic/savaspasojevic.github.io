				<p class = "indent">My name is Sava Spasojevic and I have advanced analytic capabilities that I apply to mathematics and information science. I obtained my B.Sc. from UCLA in applied mathematics and have been conducting independent research since.</p>
				<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px #50a3ff solid; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 20px;">Why Conduct Independendent Research?</h3>
				<p class="indent">I was a very optimistic person upon graduation despite the fact that I had so few friends actually show up. Those that did, however, made the moment one of the best in my life. I remained optimistic, since the summer was spectacular, but was wholly unaware of the fact that the decisions I were to make would have a resounding impact on many people. I can only assume that I was not as cautious as I should have been and perhaps some decisions were better forgone. I had a recurring problem after graduation however. It seemed as though wherever I went I was berated in some way despite the fact that I was very clearly percieved as a leader. I enjoy a challenge, but in a way I was caught between wrestling with untenable egos, giving orders at the expense of my teammates' opinion of me, or bearing a burden that would weigh too heavily on my shoulders to allow me to work on projects in my spare time. Another issue I faced was the considerable divide between the older people with respected authority and the momentum of current trends. It seemed as though certain characters that entirely captivated my attention were not at all on the minds of those that were attempting to offer advice.</p>
				<p class ="indent"> Online applications were a miserable failure. I have totalled 175 applications with only one success. In interviews, the only propositions that I seemed to run in to were those that requested years of indefatigable service in exchange for a statistically insignificant chance at success. I wholeheartedly rejected such propositions and kept it in the back of my mind that if I were ever to take that route it would be for the sake of discovering mathematics, completing my market picture, and edifying the world. Before embarking on such a journey, I tried once more to live a normal life and found employment at my local Domino's pizza, my one success. Again, I ran into the same such issues and decided that if I was to exert so much energy into the construction of pizzas, I might as well channel that energy into something that I have always loved. So, in February I left Domino's and decided that I was to either read my books until I was proficient enough to make a positive impact on the world or until I had collapsed. 
				</p>
				<p class = "indent">I had not realized the scope of my decision, but I knew that I was prepared for success for several key reasons. The first is my overall life experience. It is tremendous, so much so that I may feel reasonable in being confident in myself. I have had remarkably intelligent friends thoughout my life, and by keeping them in mind I was able to simplify my decision making process. Prior to the global shutdown, I recieved a bit of good fortune. Outside my house was placed a book, "The Banker's New Clothes." Normally I walk past items that aren't mine, but this felt like some divine occurence, so I had to pick it up. I began reading it, and I felt as if the authors were adressing me personally. I learned very quickly the fundamental terms, concepts, and ideas and thought them over extensively. Within the first week of the pandemic, I continued my fiscal education by renting an options trading book from the library.</p>
				<p>
				<p class = "indent">Shortly thereafter, the global shutdown was made more restrictive and I turned to YouTube for clarity, and with newfound common sense. This is the reason that I had decided to proceed with my research. I had developed a strong foundational knowledge of how to navigate markets to accompany my quantitative knowledge from before. Besides, I had already committed to the project and could not back out without sacrificing personal diginity or public good. Despite being the subject of tremendous uncertainty, all the hardship served to strenghten my resolve and increase my knowledge of the world. Although many areas that were previously lit went dark, many areas that were previously dark were brought to light, which helped complete my market picture. </p>

				The mathematics served as a sharpening tool that refined my analytic skills so that I may more accurately percieve current events. I concluded my researches when I produced enough and felt my understanding of mathematics was complete, in the sense that any and all directions that I were to pursue would simply be a matter of technical proficiency and not of fundamental understanding. I had in my heart of hearts my fellow Bruins. I promised them I would not return to campus unless I was a model of achievement. Returning as anything less would be too disheartening to bear. It was for them that I rejected ridiculous propositions and took considerable risk. Now that I see all my support, I would like to include those that put their trust in me in that category as well. In <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, Dickens writes "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!" And as Leonidas said in the movie <i>300</i>, "That's an easy choice."</p>
